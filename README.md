# Neural Network from scratch

## General Goal

Implementation of a fully connected neural network from scratch. 
This network can reach 99% accuracy on MNIST test data set.
You can compare this code with fully connected neural network of keras
with these scripts.

## Part

The fully connected neural network is in the script FC_nn.py
You can test it by using the jupyter notebook compare_fc_nn
You can also compare the performance of FC_nn.py with
the fully connected neural network of keras using
the notebook compare_fc_nn
